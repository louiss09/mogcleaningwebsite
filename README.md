## Environment Setup

### PHP Mailer
Set the following environment variables on the server that runs `php/contact.php`:

- `SMTP_HOST`
- `SMTP_USER`
- `SMTP_PASS`
- `SMTP_PORT`

The PHP endpoint will throw a runtime error if any of these are missing, which keeps secrets out of version control.

Optional overrides:

- `SMTP_SECURE` â€” `ssl`/`smtps`, `tls`/`starttls`, or `none` (defaults to SSL on port 465 otherwise STARTTLS)
- `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` and `MAIL_FROM_NAME`
- `MAIL_TO_ADDRESS` and `MAIL_TO_NAME`

By default the mailer authenticates with the SMTP user (set this to `info@mogcleaning.com.au`) and sends each submission to
`quotes@mogcleaning.com.au`, setting the reply-to header to the requester so the team can respond directly. Use the optional
overrides above if you need to change the sender or recipient without editing the script.

### Front-end Contact Endpoint
During local development or when deploying the static site separately from the PHP endpoint, set `VITE_CONTACT_ENDPOINT` in a `.env` file or your hosting provider's environment settings so the React app knows where to post contact form submissions. It defaults to `/contact.php` when unset.

When running `npm run dev`, Vite now provides a lightweight mock of `/contact.php` so you can test the quote form workflow without a PHP server. The mock logs submissions to the terminal and always responds with a success payload. Deployments should continue to point `VITE_CONTACT_ENDPOINT` to the real PHP handler.
